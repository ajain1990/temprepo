# FIST: Fault Injection Simulation and Testing ![Awesome](https://github.com/ajain1990/temprepo/blob/master/136292266318812803fist_test.svg.thumb.png)

## Introduction
There are many things about the software which only developer knows can fail, and our software is often expected to be able to handle those failures. But how do we test our failure handling code, when it's not easy to make a failure appear in the first place? One way to do it is to perform fault injection.

According to Wikipedia, "fault injection is a technique for improving the coverage of a test by introducing faults in order to test code paths, in particular error handling code paths that might otherwise rarely be followed. It is often used with stress testing and is widely considered to be an important part of developing robust software".

FIST is a framework that we can use to add fault injection to our Starling code. It aims to be easy to use by means of a simple API, with minimal code impact and little runtime overhead when enabled. This means that for enabling FIST, there are modifications which we have to make in our code and build system.
